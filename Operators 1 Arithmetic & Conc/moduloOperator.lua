--[[Check if a player's score is a multiple of 10 using the modulo operator. 
Create a variable called playerScore and assign it the value 85. Then use the
 modulo operator to find the remainder when dividing the score by 10, and store 
 this result in a variable called remainder. Print the remainder value.]]


-- Create the playerScore variable and assign it the value 85
local playerScore = 85

-- TODO: Write your code here to calculate the remainder using modulo operator
remainder = playerScore % 10
-- Print the remainder
print(remainder)
