--[[Calculate the area of a square garden plot using the exponentiation operator. 
Create a variable called sideLength and assign it the value 7. Then use the exponentiation 
operator to calculate the area by raising the side length to the power of 2, and store this 
result in a variable called area. Print the calculated area.]]


-- Create variables for the garden plot calculation
local sideLength = 7

-- TODO: Write your code here to calculate the area using exponentiation
area = sideLength ^ 2
-- Print the calculated area
print(area)
