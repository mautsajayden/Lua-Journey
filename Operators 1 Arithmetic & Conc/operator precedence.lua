--[[Calculate the average of three test scores using proper operator precedence. Create three variables for the test scores, 
then write a single expression that correctly calculates their average.

Create the following variables:

score1 with the value 85
score2 with the value 92
score3 with the value 78
Write a single expression to calculate the average by adding all three scores and dividing by 3. Use parentheses to ensure the addition happens before the division.
 Store the result in a variable called average and print it.]]


-- Create the test score variables
local score1 = 85
local score2 = 92
local score3 = 78

-- TODO: Write your code here to calculate the average using proper operator precedence
average = (score1 + score2  + score3 ) / 3
-- Print the result
print(average)
